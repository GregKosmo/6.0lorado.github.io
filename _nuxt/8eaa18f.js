I'd been going to a lot of cruises since all the car shows shut down, and the 97 Explorer I'd been driving since high-school wasn't cutting it any more. I wanted something unique; something that was fun to drive but still practical. Not to mention something that wouldn't jack up my insurance rates. A Focus ST might have checked a lot of the boxes above but I didn't want a $250 a month premium. I'd watched Tommyfyeah for a while so I was already familiar with his build, and after looking into the LS swap procedure for a week I stumbled across this truck in the exact spec I wanted. 89,000 miles, 5-speed, crank windows, under 7k asking price. Bit of rust but it was pretty clean for the area I'm in. This is where it all began."},{name:"Engine + swap parts",predictedPrice:4e3,image:"engine_small.png",subParts:[{name:"Engine",actualPrice:3225.82,image:"engine_small.png",description:"I picked up this L96 from a local wrecker, basically blew my predicted budget out the window right away. I figured it was worth it though, the engine was out of a 2018 GMC Sierra and had only 40,000 miles on it. Before going this route, I was considering doing an LQ9 or LQ4 swap, which would have been a much cheaper entry point on the engine, but sourcing other parts (E40 ECU specifically) was a different story. For the record, in my experience it was not difficult at all to do a Gen 4 swap in a pre '09 Colorado. If anything it looks like it would've been harder to swap a Gen 3."},{name:"AR5 to LS bellhousing adapter",actualPrice:164.95,urls:["https://www.fabbotfab.com/collections/transmission-adapters/products/ar5-to-ls-bellhousing"],image:"bellhousing_small.png",description:"Needed this to adapt the stock AR5 5-speed to the new engine.

I reached out to Current Performance on Facebook to get the process started since the harnesses are built to order. You have to fill out a form with all your truck/engine info, but it's not too bad at all. Just take time to research all the parts you're using, and include part numbers if you can. A tip I'd have in hindsight if you're doing a similar swap is to make sure you use pretty much all the 5.3 Colorado parts you can. I was very determined to use some of the 2018 GMC Sierra / stock 4 cylinder parts and it just made things more difficult. There ended up being some unrelated wiring issues as well, but their support was a great deal of help when working through those.

Had to remove a wire from the fuse box plug, install a relay from the ignition switch, and cut and re-wire the ignition wire to override the ECU. Took a bit of work to figure out what was wrong, but it works great now. If you're running into issues and/or have similar symptoms that I did (turn key, no start) I still recommend reaching out to Current Performance's support email at tech@currentperformance.com.
